	\section{Introduction}
	
	The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is neural sequence model that achieves state of the art
	performance on important tasks that include language modeling
	\cite{mikolov2012statistical}, speech recognition
	\cite{graves2013speech}, and machine translation
	\cite{kal13}.  It is known that successful applications of
	neural networks require good regularization. Unfortunately, dropout
	\cite{srivastava2013improving}, the most powerful regularization method
	for feedforward neural networks, does not work well with
	RNNs. As a result, practical applications of RNNs often
	use models that are too small because large RNNs tend to overfit.  
	Existing regularization methods give relatively small improvements for
	RNNs \cite{graves2013generating}.
	In this work, we show that dropout, when correctly used,
	greatly reduces overfitting in LSTMs, and evaluate it on three different problems.
	
	
	The code for this work will be available by the time of the publication.
	%The code for this work can be found in \url{https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm}.
	
	\section{Related work}
	
	Dropout \cite{srivastava2013improving} is a recently introduced
	regularization method that has been very successful with
	feed-forward neural networks.   While much work has extended dropout in  
	various ways \cite{wang2013fast,wan2013regularization}, there has
	been relatively little research in applying it to RNNs. The only
	paper on this topic is by Bayer et al.~\cite{bayer2013fast}, who focuses on
	``marginalized dropout'' \cite{wang2013fast}, a
	noiseless deterministic approximation to standard dropout.
	Bayer et al.~\cite{bayer2013fast} claim that conventional dropout does not work well
	with RNNs because the recurrence amplifies noise, which in turn hurts learning. 
	In this work, we show that this problem can be fixed by
	applying dropout to a certain subset of the RNNs' connections.  As a result, RNNs
	can now also benefit from dropout.
	
	
	Independently of our work, Pham et al.~\cite{pham2013dropout}
	developed the very same RNN regularization method and applied it to
	handwriting recognition.  We rediscovered this method and demonstrated
	strong empirical results over a wide range of problems.  Other work
	that applied dropout to LSTMs is Pachitariu and Sahani
	\cite{pachitariu2013regularization}.
	
	There have been a number of architectural variants of the RNN that
	perform better on problems with long term dependencies
	\cite{hochreiter1997long, graves2009novel, cho2014learning,
		jaeger2007optimization, koutnik2014clockwork, sundermeyer2012lstm}.  In this work, we
	show how to correctly apply dropout to LSTMs, the most
	commonly-used RNN variant; this way of applying dropout is likely to
	work well with other RNN architectures as well. 
	
	In this paper, we consider the following tasks: language modeling,
	speech recognition, and machine translation.  Language modeling is the
	first task where RNNs have achieved substantial success
	\cite{mikolov2010recurrent, mikolov2011strategies,
		pascanu2013construct}.  RNNs have also been successfully used for
	speech recognition \cite{robinson1996use, graves2013speech} and have
	recently been applied to machine translation, where they are 
	used for language modeling, re-ranking, or phrase modeling
	\cite{devlin14,kal13,cho2014learning,chow1987byblos,mikolov2013exploiting}.
	
	
	\section{Regularizing RNNs with LSTM cells}
	
	In this section we describe the deep LSTM (Section \ref{sec:lstm}). Next, 
	we show how to regularize them (Section \ref{sec:reg}), and explain
	why our regularization scheme works.
	
	We let subscripts denote timesteps and superscripts denote 
	layers.  All our states are $n$-dimensional.  Let $h^l_t
	\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a hidden state in layer $l$ in timestep
	$t$. Moreover, let $T_{n,m}:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$
	be an affine transform ($Wx + b$ for some $W$ and $b$).
	Let $\odot$ be element-wise multiplication and let $h^0_t$ be an
	input word vector at timestep $k$.  We use the activations $h^{L}_t$ to predict $y_t$,
	since $L$ is the number of layers in our deep LSTM.
	
	\subsection{Long-short term memory units}
	\label{sec:lstm}
	
	The RNN dynamics can be described using deterministic transitions
	from previous to current hidden states. 
	The deterministic state transition is a function
	\begin{align*}
	&\text{RNN} : h^{l-1}_t, h^l_{t-1} \rightarrow h^l_t
	\end{align*}
	
	For classical RNNs, this function is given by
	\begin{align*}
	h^l_t = f(T_{n,n}h^{l-1}_t + T_{n,n}h^l_{t-1}) \text{, where $f \in \{\mathrm{sigm}, \tanh\}$ }
	\end{align*}
	
	The LSTM has complicated dynamics that allow it to
	easily ``memorize'' information for an extended number of timesteps.  The
	``long term'' memory is stored in a vector of \emph{memory cells}
	$c^l_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  Although many LSTM architectures
	that differ in their connectivity structure and activation functions,
	all LSTM architectures have explicit memory cells for storing
	information for long periods of time.  The LSTM can decide
	to overwrite the memory cell, retrieve it, or keep it for the next time
	step.  The LSTM architecture used in our experiments is given by the
	following equations \cite{graves2013speech}:
	\begin{align*}
	&\text{LSTM} : h^{l-1}_t, h^l_{t-1}, c^l_{t - 1} \rightarrow h^l_t, c^l_t\\
	&\begin{pmatrix}i\\f\\o\\g\end{pmatrix} =
	\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{sigm}\\\mathrm{sigm}\\\mathrm{sigm}\\\tanh\end{pmatrix}
	T_{2n,4n}\begin{pmatrix}h^{l - 1}_t\\h^l_{t-1}\end{pmatrix}\\
	&c^l_t = f \odot c^l_{t-1} + i \odot g\\
	&h^l_t = o \odot \tanh(c^l_t)\\
	\end{align*}
	In these equations, $\mathrm{sigm}$ and $\tanh$ are applied
	element-wise. Figure \ref{fig:lstm} illustrates the LSTM
	equations.

	\subsection{Regularization with Dropout} 
	\label{sec:reg}
	
	The main contribution of this paper is a recipe for applying 
	dropout to LSTMs in a way that successfully reduces overfitting.
	The main idea is to apply the dropout operator only to the non-recurrent connections
	(Figure \ref{fig:reg}).  The following equation describes it more precisely,
	where ${\bf D}$ is the dropout operator that sets a random subset of
	its argument to zero:
	
	\begin{align*}
	&\begin{pmatrix}i\\f\\o\\g\end{pmatrix} =
	\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{sigm}\\\mathrm{sigm}\\\mathrm{sigm}\\\tanh\end{pmatrix}
	T_{2n,4n}\begin{pmatrix}{\bf D}(h^{l - 1}_t)\\h^l_{t-1}\end{pmatrix}\\
	&c^l_t = f \odot c^l_{t-1} + i \odot g\\
	&h^l_t = o \odot \tanh(c^l_t)\\
	\end{align*}

		\label{fig:reg}
	\end{figure}
	
	Our method works as follows. The dropout operator
	corrupts the information carried by the units, forcing them to
	perform their intermediate computations more robustly. At the same
	time, we do not want to erase all the information from the units. It is especially
	important that the units remember events that occurred many timesteps in the
	past. Figure \ref{fig:flow} shows how information could flow from an
	event that occurred at timestep ${t-2}$ to the prediction in timestep $t+2$
	in our implementation of dropout. We can see that the information is
	corrupted by the dropout operator exactly $L + 1$ times, and this
	number is independent of the number of timesteps traversed by the
	information.  Standard dropout perturbs the
	recurrent connections, which makes it 
	difficult for the LSTM to learn to store information for long periods of time.  By not
	using dropout on the recurrent connections, the LSTM can benefit
	from dropout regularization without sacrificing its valuable
	memorization ability.

	\section{Experiments}
	
	We present results in three domains: language modeling (Section \ref{sec:lang}), 
	speech recognition (Section \ref{sec:speech}), machine translation (Section \ref{sec:trans}),
	and image caption generation (Section \ref{sec:caption}).
	
	\subsection{Language modeling}
	\label{sec:lang}
	
	We conducted word-level prediction experiments on the Penn Tree Bank
	(PTB) dataset \cite{marcus1993building}, which consists of $929$k
	training words, $73$k validation words, and $82$k test words. It has
	$10$k words in its vocabulary. We downloaded it from Tomas Mikolov's webpage\footnote{\url{http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/simple-examples.tgz}}.
	We trained regularized LSTMs of two
	sizes; these are denoted the medium LSTM and large LSTM.  Both LSTMs
	have two layers and are unrolled for $35$ steps. We initialize the
	hidden states to zero.  We then use the final hidden states of
	the current minibatch as the initial hidden state of the subsequent minibatch
	(successive minibatches sequentially traverse the training set).  
	The size of each minibatch is 20.

	The medium LSTM has $650$ units per layer
	and its parameters are initialized uniformly in $[-0.05,
	0.05]$. As described earlier, we apply $50\%$ dropout on the non-recurrent connections. We
	train the LSTM for $39$ epochs with a learning rate of $1$, and after
	$6$ epochs we decrease it by a factor of $1.2$ after each epoch. We
	clip the norm of the gradients (normalized by minibatch size) at $5$. 
	Training this network takes about half a day on an NVIDIA K20 GPU. 
	
	The large LSTM has $1500$ units per layer and its parameters are
	initialized uniformly in $[-0.04, 0.04]$. We apply $65\%$ dropout on
	the non-recurrent connections. We train the model for total $55$ epochs.
	We start with learning rate of $1$;  after $14$ epochs we start to reduce the learning rate by a
	factor of $1.15$ after each epoch. We clip the norm of
	the gradients (normalized by minibatch size) at $10$ \cite{mikolov2010recurrent}. Training this
	network takes an entire day on an NVIDIA K20 GPU.
	
	For comparison, we trained a non-regularized network. 
	We optimized its parameters to get the best validation performance.
	The lack of regularization
	effectively constrains size of the network, forcing us to use small network because larger networks overfit. 
	Our best performing non-regularized LSTM has two hidden layers with $200$ units per layer, and its weights are initialized
	uniformly in $[-0.1, 0.1]$.
	We train it for $4$ epochs 
	with a learning rate of $1$ and then we decrease the learning rate by a factor of $2$ after each epoch, for a total of $13$ training epochs.
	The size of each minibatch is $20$, and we unroll the network for $20$ steps. Training this network takes 2-3 hours
	on an NVIDIA K20 GPU.
	
	Table \ref{tab:ptb} compares previous results with our LSTMs, and
	Figure \ref{fig:meaning} shows samples drawn from a single large 
	regularized LSTM.
	
	
	\subsection{Speech recognition}
	\label{sec:speech}
	
	Deep Neural Networks have been used for acoustic modeling for over half a century (see
	Bourlard and Morgan \cite{BourlardASR} for a good review). Acoustic modeling is a key
	component in mapping acoustic signals to sequences of words, as it
	models $p(s_t|X)$ where $s_t$ is the phonetic state at time $t$ and $X$
	is the acoustic observation. Recent work has shown that LSTMs can 
	achieve excellent performance on acoustic modeling \cite{sak2014speech}, yet
	relatively small LSTMs (in terms of the number of their parameters) can
	easily overfit the training set. A useful metric for measuring the performance of acoustic models is frame
	accuracy, which is measured at each $s_t$ for all timesteps
	$t$. Generally, this metric correlates with the actual metric of
	interest, the Word Error Rate (WER). Since computing the WER
	involves using a language model and tuning the decoding parameters for
	every change in the acoustic model, we decided to focus on frame
	accuracy in these experiments. Table~\ref{tab:speech} shows
	that dropout improves the frame accuracy of the LSTM. Not
	surprisingly, the training frame accuracy drops due to the noise added
	during training, but as is often the case with dropout, this yields
	models that generalize better to unseen data. Note that the test
	set is easier than the training set, as its accuracy is higher.  We
	report the performance of an LSTM on an internal Google Icelandic
	Speech dataset, which is relatively small (93k utterances), so
	overfitting is a great concern.

	\subsection{Machine translation}
	\label{sec:trans}
	
	%We report the performance of an LSTM on a machine translation task.
	We formulate a machine translation problem as a language modelling task, where
	an LSTM is trained to assign high probability to a correct
	translation of a source sentence.  Thus, the LSTM is trained on
	concatenations of source sentences and their translations 
	\cite{sutskever2014sequence} (see also Cho et al.~\cite{cho2014learning}). We compute a translation by 
	approximating the most probable sequence of words
	using a simple beam search with a beam of size 12.  We ran an
	LSTM on the WMT'14 English to French dataset, on the
	``selected'' subset from \cite{wmt_joint} which has 340M French words
	and 304M English words.  Our LSTM has 4 hidden layers, and both its
	layers and word embeddings have 1000 units.  Its 
	English vocabulary has 160,000 words and its French vocabulary has
	80,000 words.  The optimal dropout probability was 0.2.
	Table \ref{tab:mt} shows the performance of an LSTM trained with and without dropout.
	While our LSTM does not beat the phrase-based LIUM SMT system
	\cite{lium}, our results show that dropout improves the
	translation performance of the LSTM.

	\label{sec:caption}
	
	\begin{table}[th]

		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.15}
		\begin{tabular}{lll}
			\hline
			Model & Test perplexity & Test BLEU score \\
			\hline
			Non-regularized model & 8.47 & 23.5 \\
			Regularized model & 7.99 &  24.3 \\
			\hline
			10 non-regularized models  & 7.5  &  24.4 \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Results on the image caption generation task. }
		\label{tab:vis}
	\end{table}
	
	
	
	We applied the dropout variant 
	to the image caption generation model of Vinyals et al.~\cite{vinyals2014show}.  The 
	image caption generation is similar to the sequence-to-sequence model
	of Sutskever et al.~\cite{sutskever2014sequence}, but where the input image is mapped
	onto a vector with a highly-accurate pre-trained convolutional
	neural network \citep{szegedy2014going}, which is converted
	into a caption with a single-layer LSTM (see Vinyals et al.~\cite{vinyals2014show}
	for the details on the architecture).  We test our dropout scheme on  
	LSTM as the convolutional neural network is not trained on the image caption
	dataset because it is not large (MSCOCO \citep{lin2014microsoft}). 
	
	Our results are summarized in the following Table \ref{tab:vis}.  In brief,
	dropout helps relative to not using dropout, but using an ensemble
	eliminates the gains attained by dropout.  Thus, in this setting,
	the main effect of dropout is to produce a single model that is as
	good as an ensemble, which is a reasonable improvement given
	the simplicity of the technique.  
	
	
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	We presented a simple way of applying dropout to LSTMs that results in
	large performance increases on several problems in different domains.
	Our work makes dropout useful for RNNs, and our results suggest that
	our implementation of dropout could improve performance on a wide
	variety of applications.
